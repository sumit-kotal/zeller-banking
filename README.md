# Transaction-Based Banking Application

## Project Overview

This project is a transaction-based banking application aimed at providing a seamless user experience for depositing and withdrawing money while viewing past transactions. The application has been refactored to improve code quality, maintainability, and scalability by implementing best practices and using modern libraries and architectural patterns.

## Refactoring Strategy

### 1. Kotlin DSL for Gradle

To modernize the build process, we have shifted from Groovy to Kotlin for the Gradle build scripts. This change improves readability and leverages Kotlin's type safety features.

### 2. MVVM Architecture

The project is restructured to follow the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern. This pattern separates the UI logic from the business logic, making the codebase more modular, testable, and maintainable.

### 3. Libraries and Tools

- **Hilt**: Used for dependency injection to manage the creation and sharing of components efficiently.
- **Room**: Utilized for local database storage, providing an abstraction layer over SQLite.
- **MVVM Lifecycle Components**: Integrated to handle UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way, ensuring data survives configuration changes like screen rotations.

### 4. Function Names

Descriptive function names are added throughout the project to aid future developers in understanding the codebase and its functionality.

## Project Structure

The project follows the MVVM architecture:

- **Model**: Contains the data classes and repository interfaces.
- **View**: Includes the Activities, Fragments, and XML layout files.
- **ViewModel**: Holds the ViewModel classes that interact with the repository to fetch and manipulate data.

## Future Development Thoughts

### 1. Authentication

- **Login and Signup Pages**: Implement user authentication with login and signup functionalities.
- **Biometric Authentication**: Enhance security by adding support for biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint, face recognition).

### 2. User Experience

- **Predefined Add Money Amounts**: Use chips to provide predefined amounts for easy deposits.
- **Compose UI**: Transition the UI to Jetpack Compose for a more modern and flexible UI, facilitating future moves to multiplatform development.

### 3. Data Security

- **Data Encryption/Decryption**: Implement encryption and decryption mechanisms to secure sensitive user data.
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys) in secure vaults or GitHub secrets.

### 4. CI/CD Pipelines

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment**: Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment processes, enhancing collaboration and efficiency among team members.

### 5. Centralized Library Versions

All library versions should be centralized in a single file (`versions.gradle.kts`). This approach simplifies version management and ensures consistency across the project.

### 6. Additional Enhancements

- **Analytics and Monitoring**: Integrate tools for monitoring app performance and user behavior to gather insights and improve user experience.
- **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to enable or disable features without redeploying the app, allowing for safer rollouts and A/B testing.
- **Modularization**: Break down the app into feature modules to improve build times and code maintainability.

By implementing these changes and enhancements, we aim to create a robust, scalable, and user-friendly banking application that can evolve with future requirements and technological advancements.
